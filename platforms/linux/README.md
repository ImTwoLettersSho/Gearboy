Gearboy is a Nintendo Game Boy / Game Boy Color emulator written in C++.

The main focus of this emulator is readability of source code. Nevertheless, it has a high compatibility ratio.

A lot of effort has gone into this in order to follow OOP and keep it as simple and efficient as possible.

Compiling Instructions
----------------------

### Linux
- You need at least Netbeans 7.2 for C++.
- Install Qt development dependencies (Ubuntu: <code>sudo apt-get install qt4-dev-tools</code>).
- Install OpenGL development dependencies (Ubuntu: <code>sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev</code>).
- Install SDL development dependencies (Ubuntu: <code>sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev</code>).
- In order to use OpenGL extensions I used GLEW dependencies (Ubuntu: <code>sudo apt-get install libglew1.6-dev</code>). This is because of a [bug](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11845230/glgenbuffers-crashes-in-release-build) in QGLFunctions.
- Open the Gearboy Netbeans project and build.
- Alternatively you can use <code>make -f nbproject/Makefile-Release.mk SUBPROJECTS= .build-conf</code> to build the project.
- In Ubuntu 12.04 I had to <code>export SDL_AUDIODRIVER=ALSA</code> before running the emulator for the sound to work properly.
